# ROBOISM_INDI_PROJECT
My BotAstra project was to make a parking detection system. 
The project can be extended to an object detection system or to an alarm detection system that detects an alarm when an object approaches its range.
The prototype works as follows:
There are 3 LEDs and a piezo buzzer.
When the object just enters the desired range of IR Sensor, then one LED glows and the piezo buzzer makes a slow sound.
When the object approaches more towards the IR Sensor, then 2 LEDs glow and the intensity of the sound of the piezo buzzer increases.
When the object reaches even closer to the IR Sensor, then 3 LEDs glow and the intensity of the sound of the piezo buzzer reaches its maximum value.
Distance between 56cm to 74cm – 1 LED 1000Hz;
Distance between 28cm to 56cm – 2 LEDs 500Hz;
Distance less than 28cm – 3 LEDs 100Hz
